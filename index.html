        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Nicholas Brinkley and I am a second-year student majoring in Biology and minoring in Business Administration, currently interested in pursuing a career in the dental field. I am an Honors pre-dental student student and experienced tutor skilled at communicating, organizing, and solving problems with a passion to learn and advance in the field of biomedical sciences. Not only do I seek to spark excitement and interest within CNAS students of all the countless STEM and recreational programs UCR has to offer, I want to become a more capable and responsible role model. College is an incredible opportunity, and now that I am well into my second year at UC Riverside, I truly realize that UCR has allowed me to establish lifelong relationships and connections but has also provided me with various opportunities for research and other scientific and academic endeavors. I want to inspire other CNAS freshman, and as a Peer Mentor, I know can effectively motivate and empower students.
					
I entered college with a clear dream of pursuing a career in dentistry, and while that aspiration is still bright, being a student in a CNAS Learning Community has opened my eyes to the fascination and thrill of research. Taking Dynamic Genome during my fall quarter was such a special opportunity as I was able to experience proper collegiate level research through the practice and implementation of cutting-edge lab technologies as a first-year student. I am currently inquiring into various labs that interest me, and in doing so, I have glimpsed the plethora of different fields of research and academia that CNAS has to offer. To me, it is imperative that I share my passion, opportunities, and experiences in CNAS with UC Riversideâ€™s future generations of scientific scholars.						
Furthermore I have other work experience including volunteering at the Riverside Free Clinic (Dental Clinic), where I Provide free interdisciplinary health and wellness care to the underserved population of the Inland Empire with cleanings, extractions, and fillings specifically within the Dental Clinic. Additionally, as Future Dentist Club Public Relations Chair I Take photos and video footage at every big trip, social, volunteer event, all meetings where guest speakers are present. I also email all members at least one week prior to the meeting date. At the beginning of each quarter, I must create flyers and banners and distribute them at least one week prior to the first meeting. I also produce PowerPoint presentations for the general club meetings. As Global Dental Brigades Co-Publicity/Marketing Chair I am responsible for the recruitment of potential members and brigaders as well as being in charge of recruitment events, including but not limited to: campus tabling, HPAC, classroom announcements, other club meetings, emails, social media. Finally, I worked as an Martial Arts Assistant Instructor at my Taekwondo studio. I assisted the head instructor of the taekwondo studio by teaching students in training, sparring, and competition. I trained with Iron Fist Martial arts for eight years, and began working as an assistant instructor during sophomore year of high school.
